# README.md

This repository is fairly self-explanatory. Here you will find notes on whatever I feel like compiling.

This is a massive work in progress. Do expect the files here to be incomplete for some time coming :P.

[My website](https://n00bcak.github.io/) also provides links to these documents so... I guess I'm not exactly sure why you're here.
